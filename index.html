        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I learned about web development through research on what fields were available within tech. After, I decided
        to try to delve into a bit of coding through free online resources to see if it was something I liked. I found
        that it was exciting to create new things and would love to help others bring their vision to life.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Besides coding, I enjoy singing to slow music and taking quiet walks with my dogs</p>
